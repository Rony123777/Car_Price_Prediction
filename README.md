Introduction
Car price prediction is a common problem in the automotive industry and can be useful for various applications such as insurance, valuation, and sales forecasting. In this project, we utilize machine learning algorithms to build predictive models that estimate the price of a car based on its features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various cars, including features like make, model, year, mileage, engine size, fuel type, and more. The dataset is stored in a CSV file named car_data.csv.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory.
bash
Copy code
cd car-price-prediction
Install the required dependencies using pip.
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the car price prediction models, follow these steps:

Ensure that you have installed all the dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
Run the car_price_prediction.py script.
Copy code
python car_price_prediction.py
The script will load the dataset, perform exploratory analysis, train the regression models, and evaluate their performance.
After the models are trained, you will be prompted to enter the car details for which you want to predict the price.
Enter the required details, and the script will display the predicted price using each of the three algorithms.
Exploratory Analysis
The exploratory analysis section of the project involves understanding the dataset, performing data cleaning and preprocessing, and visualizing the data. The analysis helps in gaining insights into the dataset and identifying any patterns or correlations that can be useful in building accurate models.

Machine Learning Algorithms
We have implemented the following three regression algorithms for car price prediction:

Linear Regression: This algorithm assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable. It estimates the coefficients for each feature and uses them to make predictions.

RandomForest Regressor: RandomForest is an ensemble learning algorithm that creates a multitude of decision trees and combines their predictions to obtain the final result. It is capable of capturing complex relationships between features and the target variable.

GradientBoost Regressor: GradientBoost is another ensemble learning algorithm that builds a series of weak prediction models (typically decision trees) and combines their predictions in a weighted manner. It sequentially improves the models by minimizing the errors of the previous models.
